Legacy of Zann Public Github. If you wish to make changes or improves scripts or like to help then feel free, depending on changes they might be merged.

Legacy of Zann is a hybrid between a Rebalance and a Mod, it adds on the Base FOC but also adds New: Units, Buildings, GC Maps (Skirmish Maps coming soon). 
With inspiration from AOTR, This mod Plays as a 2/3 Faction Mod, With a Non-Underworld Campaign and a Custom Normal GC. 
If you are new to Empire at War then this is a must try, With it not falling far from Base Game but not to Close either.
